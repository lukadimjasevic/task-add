## Why TaskAdd ?

In today's world, the need for time organization is becoming increasingly important, both in private life and in business. For this reason, managing daily tasks is becoming a more complex process if we want to accurately and effectively plan our daily and future obligations. To efficiently track commitments, a system is required that allows for quick and easy monitoring and analysis of tasks. The aim of this work is to emphasize to the reader the importance of time organization to become more successful and productive in both private and business life, and to provide a simple system that allows the user to structurally organize their obligations and tasks through the application interface.

This project was primarily approached due to educational and personal interests. Educational interests are directed toward expanding the knowledge and skills needed to realize this work. The personal interest in choosing this topic stems from the experience and difficulties in task management, and thus, digital tools would enable easier and higher-quality work organization.
